OFFICE HOURS — First-Time Setup (macOS)
=========================================

Since this app isn't from the App Store, macOS blocks it the first time.
Here's the one-time fix (takes 30 seconds):

  1. DOUBLE-CLICK "install_and_run.command"
  2. A warning will pop up — click "Done" (that's OK!)
  3. Open SYSTEM SETTINGS → PRIVACY & SECURITY
  4. Scroll down — you'll see "install_and_run.command was blocked"
  5. Click "OPEN ANYWAY"
  6. Enter your password if asked

That's it! The app will install and launch automatically.
After the first time, you can just double-click to run it.
