After you right-click "install_and_run.command" and choose Open,
macOS will show a security popup.

Just click "Open" to confirm.

The app will:
  ✓ Install Python dependencies automatically
  ✓ Clear any remaining security flags
  ✓ Launch Office Hours

You only need to do this ONCE. After that, double-click works normally.
