OFFICE HOURS — First-Time Setup (macOS)
=========================================

Since this app isn't from the App Store, macOS will block it the first time.
Here's the one-time fix:

  1. RIGHT-CLICK (or Control-click) on "install_and_run.command"
  2. Choose "OPEN" from the menu
  3. A popup will appear — click "OPEN" again to confirm

That's it! The app will install and launch automatically.
After the first time, you can just double-click to run it.
