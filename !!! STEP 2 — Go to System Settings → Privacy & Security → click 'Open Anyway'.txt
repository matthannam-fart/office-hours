After macOS blocks the file, open:

    System Settings  →  Privacy & Security

Scroll down to the bottom. You'll see a message like:

    "install_and_run.command" was blocked to protect your Mac.

Click "Open Anyway" and enter your password.

The app will:
  ✓ Install Python dependencies automatically
  ✓ Clear any remaining security flags
  ✓ Launch Office Hours

You only need to do this ONCE. After that, double-click works normally.
